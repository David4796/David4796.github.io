  This week in Computer science class we kept on learning how to make contracts that do what we want it to and made exaples to show how it would work. We also learned about posn which is a new contract that we have learned about position like in a graph. In computer class we also learned how to use the computer to check if the contract we made actually works and makes sense. What we used was either the example/check-expect contract before we typed our contract the one made and then the computer would analzye it to make sure it works and does what we wanted it to do. Making contracts was a bit difficult because you had to make sure it did what you wanted it to do and that the examples you made accurately represented what the contract you made is supposed to work. After a while making contracts is a lot easier now and when I'm given a pair of examples I am able to get an idea of what their contract would look like and be able to make it so that the examples that were given are true.
