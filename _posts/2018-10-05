This week in Computer Science class we learned about how computers need for us to use contracts in order for them to know what we want them to do. In these contracts everything needs to be in a specific order or else the computer won't understand and won't know what you want it to do. We also learned about what each of the terms used in a computer means, when it's appropriate to use them, and how to use them correctly.

Right know you are probably wondering what a contract is (don't worry I did too) you may be thinking of the contacts that athletes sign as an agreement saying that they promise to work/play for a certain team and exchange the team will pay them money. Well it's different in Computer Science a contract is when your giving the computer what it expects and in return you'll get what you expect. 

I'm not really having a challenge in Computer Science class but I guess a struggle I'm having is that sometimes certain computer terms don't make sense at first but then later on I start to understand them and get the hang of it. I know that not everything can be understood just by looking at it so I'm kind of okay with this struggle.
