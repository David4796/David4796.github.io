In computer class this week we tried to use the coding website Wescheme to see if we could make the flag we chose for our project on the computer.We had to learn how we could use the put-image contract more efficiently so we had to experiment ways to make sure that the computer understood what we wanted it to do which in this case was to make our flag. In class we also learned about how order in a contact matters and how that order was going to help us use the contrart put-image right and efficiently. Ellipse's were something else we talked/learned about in class, an ellipse is basically an oval like shape which was one of the shapes we could of used to make our flag and we used in the pair programing class we did last week to learn how to use the put-image contract properly.

What I learned in computer class this week was learning how to use the rotate contract properly so that I could rotate any of the shapes I was using for my flag in this case it was a triangle I had to have it on it's side since I was trying to have the computer make the Puerto Rican flag so I had to make sure the triangle was in it's in the right place. I also learned how use the put-image contract properly so that every shape of my flag would show up properly and looked just the way I wanted it too and I made sure that sizes of each shape was just right so that one shape wouldn't take over the other. A challenge/struggle I had was trying to make sure that the color, size, and the number/pattern of the stripes was the same as the flag I chose.
