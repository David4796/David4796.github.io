The United Kingdom Flag code so far:

```(put-image(rotate 150(rectangle 600 55 "solid" "red"))250 150(put-image(rotate 390(rectangle 600 50 "solid" "red"))250 150 (rectangle 500 300 "solid" "white")))

(put-image(rotate 150(rectangle 600 55 "solid" "white"))250 150(put-image(rotate 390(rectangle 600 50 "solid" "white"))250 150 (rectangle 500 300 "solid" "blue")))

(put-image(rotate 90(rectangle 700 65 "solid" "red"))250 150(put-image(rectangle 600 65 "solid" "red")250 150 (rectangle 500 300 "solid" "white")))

(rotate 150(rectangle 300 30 "solid" "red"))

(rotate 390(rectangle 300 30 "solid" "red"))

(put-image(rotate 90(rectangle 600 55 "solid" "red")) 250 150 (put-image(rectangle 600 50 "solid" "red") 250 140 (put-image(rotate 90(rectangle 700 95 "solid" "white"))250 150(put-image(rectangle 700 85 "solid" "white") 250 140 (put-image(rotate 150(rectangle 250 20 "solid" "red")) 100 230 (put-image(rotate 150(rectangle 250 20 "solid" "red"))420 60 (put-image(rotate 390(rectangle 370 20 "solid" "red")) 350 210 (put-image(rotate 390(rectangle 370 20 "solid" "red")) 40 20 (put-image(rotate 150(rectangle 600 50 "solid" "white")) 250 150 (put-image(rotate 390(rectangle 600 50 "solid" "white")) 250 150 (rectangle 500 300 "solid" "blue")))))))))))```

My Reflection:
Making the United Kingdom Flag was both difficult and pretty fun too make because it involved many shapes to be made. There were many challenges I faced while making the United Kingdom Flag on WeSheme at first a challenge I faced was trying to get the three flags of England, Scotland, and North Ireland to combine with one another to make the United Kingdom Flag. Another challenges I faced was trying to find the right positions and angles for all the shapes that make up the United kingdom Flag. A third challenge I faced was figuring out what shapes went on the bottom and which ones were on the top.A fourth challenge I faced while making my flag was deciding what colors each of the shapes was going to be. Something I look forward too next week is finding out how I will be able to scale my flag just by changing one number.
