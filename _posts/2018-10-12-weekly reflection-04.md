  In computer class this week we learned about pair programing and definitions. We did pair programing to learn how professionals solved difficult problems. With the definitions what we did was give the contracts we used a definition(basically another name) so we could use the contracts faster and since we gave the contracts a definition(new name) to be known as the computer will now know what we are talking about when we put that definition(the new name we just gave it). aconnection I can make about this week's learning is thatbthe contracts we used this week were a lot like the ones from last week which I guess means we will be using these contracts a lot.

 What I learned this week in computer science class is that are many thins you can do with contracts and there are a lot of them too. Contract are one the things that allow us to use computers to their full potential and allow ou to speack their language without contracts we probably wouldn't be able to do certain things with computers. I also learned that professinals don't always work alone they also sometimes work with others to do their work and make sure it's correct. I would also like to have more time to do certain things in class like if we're using wescheme(coding website) I would love to have more time to explore my ideas and work any errors or doubts I may have.
