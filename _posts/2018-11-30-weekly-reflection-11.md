This week in Computer Science class we had a mid-term Exam so we could see how we are doing so far. so this week in my learning blog I'll talk to you about of the questions. One of the questions I'm going to talk about is at a practitioner level for mastery skill number one it was asking us what the value of the expression (/ (+(string-length "HelloWorld!") (+5 4)) 2) and to be honest I got the answer wrong to this one because I didn't know what the contract/function string-length did which was that it takes in the number of characters in the string after it which in this case was "HelloWorld!" so it would produce the number 11 because of how many characters were typed and then you would do 5 plus 4 which is 9 and then add 9 and 11 to get 20 and finally you divide 20 by 2 to get the answer 20. As I said before I got this answer wrong because I didn't know what the function/contract string-length did so I wasn't able to solve the problem correctly even though it's definition was given to me on the test I didn't notice it until the end.
