My Flag:
The Flag I chose was the United Kingdom Flag to make a flag collage out of 








Questions and challeges:
Challenges I had while making my flag collage was that I had to make sure that the shapes of my flag had to be the right size and in the rght angle or else it wouldn't look like the United Kingdom flag another challenge I had while making my flag collage was making the shapes of my flag out of the construction paper that was given to me and finding the right colors of my flag but there weren't any so I had to use different colors. What I would do differently to improve on these challenges I hdd
