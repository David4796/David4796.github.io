#Part 1-My Flag:
The Flag I chose was the United Kingdom Flag also known as Union Jack to make a flag collage out of. The United Kingdom Flag includes many shapes in it like four triangles, a red "X",and a red cross. Each one of these shapes needs to be in a specific size and order so that it looks like the way I want it to. Believe it or not there are three different flags in the United Kingdom Flag the first one is the flag from Sotland the second one is from North Ireland and the last one is from England of corse all of these

#Part 2-Questions and challenges:
Challenges I had while making my flag collage was that I had to make sure that the shapes of my flag had to be the right size and in the right angle or else it wouldn't look like the United Kingdom flag. Another challenge I had while making my flag collage was making the shapes of my flag out of the construction paper that was given to me. What I would do differently to improve on these challenges I had would be to try out ways to be able to find the right sizes for each shape on my flag easier so that I don't have to spend too much time drawing it out something else I could do is to try and use the sizes I used to draw my flag to cut them out of the construction paper.
