My Flag:
The Flag I chose was the United Kingdom Flag to make a flag collage out of 








Questions and challeges:
Challenges I had while making my flag collage was that I had to make sure that the shapes of my flag had to be the right size and in the right angle or else it wouldn't look like the United Kingdom flag. Another challenge I had while making my flag collage was making the shapes of my flag out of the construction paper that was given to me. What I would do differently to improve on these challenges I had would be to try out ways to be able to find the right sizes for each shape on my flag easier so that I don't have to spend too much time drawing it out something else I could do is to try and use the sizes I used to draw my flag to cut them out of the construction paper.
