  So far Computer Science is really fun I learn something new every time I go to this class we do alot of group discussions and activities which is pretty helpful when you have any questions on what we are doing in class. In class right now we are learning how to make Video game it's going to be a real simple one so it's not going to be as difficult game to make but there is a catch we need to work with a partner in order to make a video game we both then need to decide four important things The Player (what will they look like), The Danger (what the player will avoid), The Target (what the player will be doing throughtout the game), and The Background. It took some time to decide on what these four things would be but me and my partner were able to figure it out. A challenge I'm facing in Computer Science class right now is that it's pretty difficult to learn haw to do the circles of evaluation which is going to help us think like a computer so that we'll be able to do things on our own.
