## The United Kingdom Flag

## Describe your program

I designed a Program to make the flag of the United kingdom.To be honest I will probably get a grade of 2 or above because I was able to to make the United Kngdom Flag but have yet to be able to find out how to scale it


## Current output

* * *
![MyFlag](/images/flagV2.png)
* * *

## Describe your process.

Some advise a student gave me that helped me make the United Kingdom Flag was to make all of the diagonal lines on the flag seperatly so that it's a lot easier to do and also because if look at the United Kingdom Flag those lines are in different positions and not just one straight line.

 


## Explain your code.

-   Choose a significant part of your program (15 lines max) and paste it below. Do not insert your entire program here. _then delete this instruction_
-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_

* * *

```
(define size 100)

(define width (* 5 size))                    
(define height (* 3 size))

(define w2 (* 2.5 size)) (define h2 (* .2 size))

(define w3 (* 6 size)) (define h3 (* .55 size))

(define w4 (* 6 size)) (define h4 (* .5 size))

(define w5 (* 7 size)) (define h5 (* .85 size))

(define w7 (* 2.5 size)) (define h7 (* .2 size))

```

* * *

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.
