This week in computer Science class we learned how a value and a function are very different a function can't be changed because a function defines the contract that is being use while a value is everything after the function/contract and those value/arguments can be changed into anything really as long as the computer knows what it means and stands for or else the expression won't work. Using the Define function will allow you to give other expressions names for the computer to know them by which is pretty helpful when you are using the same expression over and over again like when I was doing my flag project 
```Racket 
function test() {
(put-image(star 20 "solid" "white") 25 55(put-image(rotate 150 (triangle 100 "solid" "blue")) 40 50(put-image (rectangle 260 20 "solid" "white") 20 70(put-image(rectangle 260 20 "solid" "white") 40 30(rectangle 150 100 "solid" "red")))))
}
``` 
I could have given the shapes expressions a much simplier name to be known as by the computer by using the Define function but I didn't because I wanted to make sure that all the shapes where the perfect size, color and in their rightful place but if I did use the Define function it would have made my flags expression a lot shorter and a lot easier to make. In Computer Science class we also learned how Computers can be used to model real life events with codes to make things like rockets go into space. We also leaned how to make our own function contracts like this one
```Racket 
function test() {
(define (mystery r)
 (circle r "outline" "red")) 
 }
``` 
As you can see the "r" seems to be replacing something maybe with an example of it you'll probably see what
```Racket 
function test() {
(EXAMPLE (mystery 30)
 (circle 30 "outline" "red"))
 }
``` 
As you can see whan we replaced the "r" with 30 it put it in the place where the radius of the circle is supposed to be meaning that "r" could be replaced with any number and the radius of the circle would either increase or decrease.
