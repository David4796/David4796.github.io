![Screenshot of my game](/images/GameScreenShot.png)

This is a Picture of my SCREENSHOT contract/function that I made on WeScheme. Wesheme provided me with five diferent contract functions PLAYER, DANGER, TARGET, BACKGROUND, and SCREENSHOT all I really had to do was add in the pictures I wanted to use, chnage the position of the photos, and scale them to their appropriate size so that they wouldn't be taking up most of the screen.
