Today is the end of our first marking period so instead of me telling you about what we have done this week I'm going to talk to you about what we have learned in computer science class so far. At the beginnigd learned what made a website a website so that then would make one of our own and have it as a learning blog. We learned about how the web is a system of interlinked documents accesed via internet and that files like HTML, CSS, index.html, and main.css helped make websites. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is the framework/structure of the website. CSS stands for cascading style sheet which is used to give website and style you want. index.html is a naming pattern expected by the computer for a home page which can opened by the HTML program. Main.css is a way to style your website by using the css program to open it.
