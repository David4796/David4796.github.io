My Impressions on my Computer Science class:
  Computer Science class so far is really great I look foward to this class everyday and hope to continue to learn more from our teacher. Computer Science class is pretty difficult especially since computers use alot of terms that are difficult to undersatnd but I think I'll be fine. Making this website was one of our first projects for this class it took some time and patience but eventually as you can see I was able to finish it and make my first blog.
  
  In Computer Science class I learned that a website needs many things before it is able to actually work and do what you want it to do like for example this website of mine is a learning blog and it needed alot of files and directories in order for it to look like it is now it took some time but it's finally up.
  
  A challenge I faced in Computer Science class is that I had a limited amount of time to finish this website and post my first blog especially since I had other things to do like my homework for my other classes but I was able to manage and finished it on time. Another challenge I faced was trying to understand what I was doing as I did this website like all the files and directories that helped me make this website.
