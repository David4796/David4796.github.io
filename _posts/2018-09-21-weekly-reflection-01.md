My impression of my computer science class so far is that it's actually pretty fun and exciting because just recently we learned how to make our own website and now we are using it as a learning blog. I also have learned that websites are pretty difficult to make and take alot of time and patience. My biggest challenge yet so far was trying to finish this website and have it up and working properly.
