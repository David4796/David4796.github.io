  This week in Computer Science class we learned how to make a contract based on the functions that were given to us and we learned how to make a function based on the contracts that were given to us. In class we leaned the Design Recipe to learn how to make a contract. 
  Step one: you write down how the contract you want to use looks like 
  Step two: you make examples on how the contract should look like when used 
  Step three: You define the contract so that the computer knows what to do when you want to use the contract you just made
Learning how to make our own contracts was a bit difficult at first since I had to make sure that the examples I made were actually doing what the contract said. After doing it a couple of times I was able to understand it and not need much help from others as much I was also able to create contracts based off of functions that were given to me like ```(show-score "red sox" "dodgers" 3)``` I had to make a contract to make this function true so I made the contract ```;show-score string string number -> image``` this contract then allowed the function to be true and be able to work on the computer. Functions and contracts are important they allow the computer to know what you want it do like when you want to create a flag or shape you would either need to use a single contract/function or multiple of them to make sure you the computer makes what you wanted it to do. This week in computer class it was pretty okay we didn't learn anything really that difficult it was more of like adding on to our learning which I'm pretty sure will come in handy in any future projects or work.
