  This week in Computer Science class we learned how to make a contracrt based on the expressions that were given to us and we learned how to make an expression based on the contracts that were given to us. In class we leaned the Design Recipe. 
  Step one: you write down how the contract you want to use looks like 
  Step two: you make examples/expressions on how the contract should look like when used 
  Step three: You define the contract so that the computer knows what to do when you want to use the contract you just made
