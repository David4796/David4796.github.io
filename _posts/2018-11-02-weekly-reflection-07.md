  This week in Computer Science class we learned how to make a contracrt based on the expressions that were given to us and we learned how to make an expression based on the contracts that were given to us. In class we leaned the Design Recipe to learn how to make a contract. 
  Step one: you write down how the contract you want to use looks like 
  Step two: you make examples/expressions on how the contract should look like when used 
  Step three: You define the contract so that the computer knows what to do when you want to use the contract you just made
Learning how to make our own contracts was a bit difficult at first since I had to make sure that the contract did what I wanted it to do and that the examples I made were actually doing what the contract said. After doing it a couple of times I was able to understand it and not need much help from others as much I was also able to create contracts based off of expressions/functions that were given to me like ```(show-score "red sox" "dodgers" 3)``` I had to make a contract to make this expression/function true so I made the contract ``` show-score string string number -> image```
